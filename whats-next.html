        If the City Council approves the rezoning, citizens of Millville have 5 days to file a referendum to challenge
        that
        decision. Such a referendum needs approximately 500 signatures from registered voters living in Millville. If
        this step is necessary,
        help get signatures from registered voters living in Millville who support the referendum.
