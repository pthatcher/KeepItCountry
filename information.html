        In 2018, a state consultant advised Millville planning and zoning and the city council on how to control the
        growth of our city. The state consultant recommended that the city's general plan include larger lot sizes so
        that if farm land got annexed into the city, it would already show it as being zoned for 2-acre lots.
        Per this meeting with the state consultant, the city council asked planning and zoning
        to show this on the general plan, which they did, and then the city council voted in favor of adding a zoning
        restriction <a

            2018-9</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        This ordinance states "Any property south of 400 South currently zoned as Agriculture
        (A) or any property
        south of 400 South annexed into city limits as Agriculture (A), that wants to be considered for a residential
        zone will only
        be considered as a Residential (R-3) Zone."
    </p>

    <p>
        On August 14 2025, the city council passed <a
            href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/o2usyy0cs43csc9a3t7sv/Ordinance-2025-5.pdf?rlkey=q4kl7ok4prgi5wuco68wepja2&e=1&st=rzubuz7t&dl=0">Ordinance
            2025-5</a>, lifting this zoning restriction by removing the text from 2018-9 from the city code.
    </p>

    <p>
        Now, a request is being made to rezone parcel <a

        (<a href="https://core.cachecounty.gov/Display/Parcel/03-035-0037/2026?chart=y">history</a>)
        from
        Agricultural (A) to Residential (R-1). The property is 35 acres and located approximately between 100 East &
        200
        East and 400 South,
        Millville. The plan is to develop this parcel into 80+ homes on â…“ acre lots.
