    <blockquote>
        "I believe the growth of the city to be the biggest issue in the next few years. Having served on the
        planning &
        zoning commission for the past 6.5 years, I feel prepared to guide the direction of growth, by following the
        city's general plan and motto 'Country Living at Its Finest.'' I would like to see development that does not
        choke out our animals and agriculture in place of cars and pavement."
