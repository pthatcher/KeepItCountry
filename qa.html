    <h2 class="question">What does Planning and Zoning think?</h2>
    <div class="answer">
        Planning and Zoning voted unanimously to reject the rezoning in question. They have rejected other rezoning
        issues in the past and were ignored by the city council. The purpose of P&amp;Z is to help the city council
        make
        educated decisions based on P&amp;Z’s research and recommendations. Planning and Zoning are in place as a
        checks
        and
        balances to make sure that city council listens to its citizens and does what's best for Millville.

    <h2 class="question">What impact will this have on traffic?</h2>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>
            If the annexed land requires 2 acre lots that would be an additional 20 homes added to the south fields, so
            around 40 more cars.
        </p>

        <p>
            If the lots are allowed to be only ⅓ acre that would be 80 or more homes which would be an additional 160
            cars
            or more. We have many pedestrians and cyclists that enjoy walking to the coyote farm everyday.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="question">What impact will this have on critical resources like water and sewer?</h2>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>
            The new sewer system has not even been tested yet. There are already 80 more homes going in behind the
            Hanceys and then add 80 more from the South Fields. Can the sewer system really handle all of these homes?
        </p>

        <p>
            Water is a precious and critical resource. This summer Millville was classed as being in “severe drought”
            conditions. This is a desert. We must be very careful and consider the impact on our water resources with
            this many new households.

    <h2 class="question">Will we be able to provide amenities like public education to this many new families?</h2>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>
            The Millville elementary school is already near max capacity.
            Once the new schools are built and the boundaries are changed it will be at 75% capacity. It is a smaller
            building and will fill up more quickly than other schools.
        </p>
    </div>


    <h2 class="question">Doesn’t the city need money for the sewer project?</h2>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>
            The impact fees that the city receives for new residences are not allowed to be used for past projects. They
            must be used for future projects that would impact those new families moving in; not take care of old
            problems
            that existed before they moved in.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="question">Are there other ways to generate money for the city?</h2>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>
            Supporting retail development is the best way to generate sustainable and ongoing money for the city. Money
            earned from sales tax would be used in a general fund that could certainly be used to pay for the sewer
            project.
            There is a large parcel on the highway near the high school that is zoned for commercial use. Why not focus
            on
            bringing in a grocery store and other retail shops? There is a lot of new high density housing in Nibley.
            Those
            people could certainly use a grocery store near home.

    <h2 class="question">How can we preserve Country Living at its Finest and still offer others the chance to move
        here?</h2>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>
            Development should be anywhere that doesn't impact agriculture. You have the east bench of Millville, where
            you can't
            grow anything but rattle snakes and sage brush. Also areas where existing roads can accommodate the traffic,
            like several fields south of the high school on 450 north. Housing makes sense there because the roads are
            already in place for the traffic. Nothing is in place for the south fields.

            The South Fields are one of the few nature preserves left in Millville. Why not keep it country out there
            and
            allow people to continue recreating and enjoying nature. Once it is lost we will never get it back.
        </p>

    <h2 class="question">I live in the North part of town, how does this affect me?</h2>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>
            We all share the water resources, and this could lead to more water restrictions, more crowded schools, more
            traffic on the roads, and higher property taxes.
