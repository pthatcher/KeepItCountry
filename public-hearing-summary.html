    <p class="c5"><span class="c0">The meeting addressed a developer&#39;s request to rezone a 35-acre parcel from

            (Residential)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to allow for a development of up to 78 homes on one-third-acre
            lots. The developer, represented by </span><span class="c0 c2">Brad Brown</span><span class="c0">, has a
            conditional purchase agreement with the property owner, </span><span class="c0 c2">Jeff Gibson</span><span

    </h3>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c1 c0">An overwhelming majority of residents who spoke were strongly opposed to the R1
            rezone proposal. Their concerns were multifaceted and often repeated by multiple speakers.</span></p>
    <h4 class="c5" id="h.2sef6niaq232"><span class="c9 c0 c2">Opposition to R-1 Zoning &amp; Density</span></h4>
    <ul class="c4 lst-kix_mq8biesypv0n-0 start">
        <li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0 c2">Contradicts Community Character:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The
                primary concern was that a high-density, third-acre lot subdivision fundamentally contradicts
                Millville&#39;s identity as a town of &quot;Country Livin&#39; at its Finest.&quot; Speakers emphasized
                that they and others moved to Millville specifically to escape suburban sprawl and enjoy open spaces.

                Charlotte McConkie, Lynda Hendrickson</span><span class="c1 c0">)</span></li>
        <li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0 c2">Loss of Open Space and Farmland:</span><span
                class="c0">&nbsp;Residents described the South Fields as a &quot;treasure&quot; and an essential part of
                the town&#39;s ambiance, used for recreation, enjoyment of views, and wildlife habitat. Many speakers
                lamented the loss of productive farmland. (</span><span class="c0 c2">Jim Christensen, Jeanette Paulsen,
                Ken Hamilton, Linda Hendrickson</span><span class="c1 c0">)</span></li>
        <li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0 c2">Negative Precedent:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;A decision to
                allow this rezone would set a precedent, likely leading other landowners in the South Fields to sell for
                similar high-density developments, irreversibly changing the entire area. (</span><span
                class="c0 c2">Jeff David</span><span class="c1 c0">)</span></li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="c5" id="h.6e1hy8oddq0"><span class="c0 c2 c9">Adherence to the General Plan</span></h4>
    <ul class="c4 lst-kix_l6hdxawdpoxi-0 start">
        <li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0 c2">Violation of Existing Plan:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Several
                speakers noted that the proposal violates the current General Plan, which calls for large-lot
                development to preserve the rural atmosphere. They argued that even if the plan is old, it is the
                legally binding document that should guide development until it is formally and publicly updated.

                class="c1 c0">)</span></li>
        <li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0 c2">Removal of Previous Protections:</span><span
                class="c0">&nbsp;Residents expressed distrust over the council&#39;s recent removal of a city code
                clause that required two-acre lots for any rezone south of 400 South, feeling it was a &quot;betrayal of
                trust&quot; that paved the way for this proposal. (</span><span class="c0 c2">Charlotte
                McConkie</span><span class="c1 c0">)</span></li>

    <h4 class="c5" id="h.4datlckdahq2"><span class="c9 c0 c2">Infrastructure &amp; Services</span></h4>
    <ul class="c4 lst-kix_exdykvcck45l-0 start">
        <li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0 c2">Water Scarcity:</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;This was a major
                data-driven concern. Residents cited Utah&#39;s drought conditions and presented calculations suggesting
                the 11 water shares associated with the property are insufficient.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="c4 lst-kix_exdykvcck45l-1 start">
        <li class="c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0 c2">Jared Nichols</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;calculated that the 78
                proposed homes would require 26 million gallons annually, while the shares provide only 19 million,
                creating a </span><span class="c0 c2">7-million-gallon deficit</span><span class="c1 c0">.</span></li>
        <li class="c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0 c2">Celeste Thatcher</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;reiterated these
                numbers and noted that Millville is in a &quot;severe drought&quot; and has had historical issues with
                nitrate levels in one of its wells.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="c4 lst-kix_exdykvcck45l-0">
        <li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0 c2">Sewer System Capacity:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The
                city&#39;s new sewer system is untested. Residents questioned its capacity to handle 78 new homes,
                especially given the existing pipe sizes in certain areas. (</span><span class="c0 c2">Jeanette Paulsen,
                Kim Ashcroft, Albert Monson</span><span class="c1 c0">)</span></li>
        <li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0 c2">School Overcrowding:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The local
                elementary school is already at capacity. Adding potentially 50+ new cars for drop-off and pick-up would
                create a &quot;nightmare&quot; and strain educational resources. (</span><span class="c0 c2">Chloe
                Baker, Kim Ashcroft</span><span class="c1 c0">)</span></li>
        <li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0 c2">Increased Traffic:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Residents,
                particularly those on Canyon Road and near the South Fields, are concerned about increased traffic,
                speeding, and recreational vehicle use on roads not designed for it. (</span><span class="c0 c2">Kady

    <ul class="c4 lst-kix_wcgmfik05uyc-0 start">
        <li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0 c2">Residential Homes as a Liability:</span><span
                class="c0">&nbsp;Multiple speakers argued that residential development is a net financial loss for a
                city, costing more in services than it generates in property taxes. (</span><span class="c0 c2">Jared
                Nichols, Luanne Pierson, Chloe Baker</span><span class="c1 c0">)</span></li>
        <li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0 c2">Questioning the City&#39;s Motivation:</span><span
                class="c0">&nbsp;Residents questioned the urgency and financial justification for the rezone.
            </span><span class="c0 c2">Theo Matthews</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;challenged the council on finances,
                questioning the salary of city employees when compared to similar positions in much larger
                communities.</span></li>
        <li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0 c2">Lack of Transparency:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Speakers
                requested more transparency from the council on why this specific development is being considered, what
                the benefits are, and why alternative revenue sources aren&#39;t being prioritized. (</span><span
                class="c0 c2">Chloe Baker, Peter Thatcher, Jeff David</span><span class="c1 c0">)</span></li>
        <li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0 c2">Timing of the Vote:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Garrett
                Greinghalgh </span><span class="c0">strongly urged the council to vote on the issue </span><span
                class="c0 c10">before</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;the upcoming election, not after, so that citizens
                could hold them accountable. She stated, &quot;to say we&#39;re gonna have the vote after the election
                holds nobody&#39;s feet to the fire.&quot;</span></li>

            Recommendation</span></h4>
    <ul class="c4 lst-kix_qguh76jdp75j-0 start">
        <li class="c3 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0 c2">Ignoring Unanimous Vote:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;It was
                raised by </span><span class="c0 c2">Theo Matthews</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;that the city&#39;s own
                Planning and Zoning Commission had reviewed the proposal and returned a </span><span
                class="c0 c2">unanimous vote against it</span><span class="c1 c0">. He questioned the council directly:
                &quot;Why ignore the unanimous Planning and Zoning Committee vote against the proposal?&quot; This was
                presented as evidence that the council was potentially acting against the recommendation of its own
                appointed advisory body and the will of the community.</span></li>

                most common proposal was to deny the R1 rezone but approve an </span><span class="c0 c2">R3 rezone for
                two-acre lots</span><span class="c0">, which would be consistent with the recently removed city code and
                the general sentiment of the community. (</span><span class="c0 c2">Riley Peterson, Jared Nichols, Cammy

        <li class="c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0 c2">Jared Nichols</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;provided a detailed
                alternative, stating he had 12 buyers (80% of whom are current Millville residents) ready to purchase 15
                two-acre lots, which would generate </span><span class="c0 c2">$330,000 in impact fees</span><span

                class="c0">&nbsp;Several residents suggested the city focus its revenue-generating efforts on the
                commercially zoned property along Highway 165 instead of relying on one-time residential impact fees.
